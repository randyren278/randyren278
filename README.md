ðŸ§ª Hi! My name is Randy, and I'm currently a second-year student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I have a passion for developing innovative coding projects that solve real-world problems. I have experience working with various programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, and React. Beyond coding, I am involved in track and field and love the outdoors.
